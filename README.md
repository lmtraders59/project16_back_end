# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

In this sprint's project I am building a back-end server for our last What-To-Wear application.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

I am mainly using Express.js for routing and middleware, MongoDB for the database, Mongoose schemas as a form of a check to accept/reject web requests,

### Running thIe Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
